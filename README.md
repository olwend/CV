## Olwen Davies 

As a seasoned software tester and new Makers Academy graduate I am seeking a Software Dev Engineer or Developer in Test role. I joined MA to raise my technical game and so assure my long term contribution and effectiveness in team driven continuous integration agile projects. I am seeking a role where I can apply my industry experience and continue to advance my development skills.  Since December I have gone from minimal coding to proficiency in Ruby, Rails and JS.  Thus I am able to learn new languages and frameworks, so am happily tech agnostic, prepared to dig in and learn whatever is required.

After several years in a variety of IT roles (data warehouse data analyst,support analyst, tester and test manager) I moved into Test analyst contract roles. My rigorous application of hands on test skills alongside sucess managing local, 3rd party and remote teams gives my consistent record of efficient testing tailored to project timelines and business or client needs.  I relish hands on technical work, so my interests led me to automated testing as a means to build quality in to software projects.  I am an advocate of early quality input, using a code based test framework to supplement TDD, growing auto tests as an independent check in parallel to growth in the code base. In turn this led me to learn coding at Makers.

I have wide interests and I see huge benefits to technology being more widely understood and better applied, thus I want to  realise user ideas for understood tasks and drive products where the end user or commissioners liaise with the creative and technical team.  I am interested in enabling technology in less digitally developed sectors.

## INDIRECT SKILLS OF GREAT USE IN CODING

#### CLARIFICATION OF USER REQUIREMENTS
Testing introduces the real world and users to the running of code, thus exposes questions and reveals gaps.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device. Checks that the interpretation of the requirement is in line with the user use of application.
Over many projects and organisations the same questions arise, a good tester becomes a touchstone and develops uncanny ability to predict issues. I have learnt to trust my hunches and ability to evidence risks prior to their breaking as issues. 

#### COMMUNICATION 
I am client focussed so see clear written and verbal communication as key to successful project delivery.
Examples of communication:
- Automated test suites as great demo tools to show non technical people what is being delivered.[Bank tech test](https://github.com/olwend/bank_tech_test)
- Timely and accurate written or verbal updates of progress and quality status to show current project status against plan.
- I'm a challenging participant in agile scrum and planning sessions.
- Assist peers to voice ideas and translate aspirations into a real plan, which a team can enact.
- Mentoring via listening, echoing back to help refine and clarify individuals personal development concerns and goals. I am proud to have mentored and trained up 6 novice testers, all are still progressing in their test careers.
- I implemented a personal development tool to clarify the agile test role and ensure test engineers were given a clear learning path for agile proficiency. This inspired my Makers academy course and my technical upskilling.

#### ISSUE REPORTING AND DEBUGGING
I enjoy the challenge of understanding legacy code, implementing tests to give clarity and documentation of system functions.
See this example of implementing tests as a basis for refactoring [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/olwend/Gilded_rose) 

#### UNDERSTANDING OF LARGE ENTERPRISE IT SYSTEMS
I have wide experience in integrated corporate domains, having worked for 5 blue chip clients over the last 5 years.
I diagram, seek to understand user flows, implement tests and analyse inputs and outputs to learn new environments.

#### MOST RECENT INDUSTRY PROJECTS

I managed the last phase test activities for a UI migration to a new platform for [Experian e-ConsumerView](http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer-information/econsumerview.html)
The actual site is restricted to subscribing finance clients. 

I led UI testing (C# auto framework) of a new Application form, interfacing to EHL switching API.
Compare The Market [Energy workflow](https://energy.comparethemarket.com/energy/v2/)

I worked on the delivery tests for [Meerkat Movies](https://www.comparethemarket.com/meerkat/movies)
This was challenging as due to hard deadline to coincide with the press releases and marketing campaign.
