## Olwen Davies DRAFT

I am currently undertaking an intensive coding boot camp with Makers Academy, London, with a view to seeking a Software Dev Engineer in Test role (SDET) in a continuous integration agile development team. 
  Further information available here https://medium.com/@olwend.
I have several years experience as a test manager, after which I moved into Test analyst contract roles. Skilled application of hands on test skills alongside my sucess managing local, 3rd party and remote teams is shown in a consistent record of efficient yet rigorous risk based testing tailored to project timelines and business client needs.  Relishing hands on technical work, I have taken interim roles moving towards automated testing.  I see the power of early quality input, by which a test professional uses a code based framework to supplement TDD, auto tests are an independent check whilst development is underway and grow with the code base. I am taking time now, to  raise my technical game and so assure my long term contribution and effectiveness on team driven agile projects. My aim is to be a pragmatic, tactical tester suited to technical work.  

I have wide interests and I see huge benefits to technology being more widely understood and better applied, thus I want to return to my starting point in IT, where I realised user ideas for understood tasks and where I was driving a product for the end user or commissioners who were the people liaising with the creative and technical team.  I am interested in enabling technology in less digitally developed sectors. 

## SKILLS - ADD MATRIX 


## INDIRECT SKILLS OF GREAT USE IN CODING
#### ISSUE REPORTING AND DEBUGGING

#### CLARIFICATION OF USER REQUIREMENTS
Testing introduces the real world and users to the running of code, thus exposes questions and reveals gaps.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device. Checks that the interpretation of the requirement is in line with the user use of application.
Over many projects and organisations the same questions arise, a good tester becomes a touchstone and develops uncanny ability to predict issues. I have learnt to trust my hunches and ability to evidence risks prior to their breaking as issues. 

#### COMMUNICATION 
- Automated test suites as great demo tools
- Timely and accurate updates to stakeholders of current status of quality and the severity to show impact on project status against plan
- Clarification of ideas and translation of aspirations into a real plan, which peers and overall team can enact.
- I'm a challenging participant in agile scrum and planning sessions.
- Management of people - listening, echoing back to help refine and clarify their development concerns and goals. I have most proud that I mentored and trained up 6 novice testers, all of whom are still progressing in their test careers.
- I implemented a personal development tool to clarify the agile test role and ensure test engineers were given a clear learning path for agile proficiency.

#### UNDERSTANDING OF LARGE ENTERPRISE IT SYSTEMS

#### MOST RECENT INDUSTRY PROJECTS

I managed the last phase test activities for a UI migration to a new platform for Experian e-ConsumerView.
