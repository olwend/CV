## Olwen Davies
I am an experienced and versatile test manager, I have been equally able to apply hands on test skills as to manage local, 3rd party and remote teams. I have a consistent record of efficient yet rigorous risk based testing tailored to project timelines and business client needs.  I am currently undertaking an intensive coding boot camp with Makers Academy, London, with a view to seeking a Software Dev Engineer in Test role (SDET) in a continuous integration agile development team.  <<Blog here>>

I have wide interests and I see huge benefits to technology being more widely understood and better applied, thus I want to return to my starting point in IT, where I realised user ideas for discrete understood tasks and where I was very close to a product. The end user or commissioners were the people liaising with the creative and technical team.  

## Skills

#### TESTING
- I rose through the test ranks to be QUALITY MANAGER FOR TREASURY AND POST TRADE 
- I managed 4 Test Team Leads, with responsibility for 30 – 40 testers and deliverables to rigorous enterprise standards.   
- Key achievements were:
- Consistent on time to quality delivery across 8 workstreams
- My team met group automation targets every year, I worked with auto testers to put a coherent and flexible, repeatable data - driven framework in place.    With a new technical team in Beijing, my area achieved 30% automation on new functionality
- and 70% on a large products regression within 6 months.  
- Working to tight client UAT schedules I ran integration test phases, where investment 
- bank trading engines could trial new algorithms against production like trading data. 
- Key to this was liaison with client and TR architects, product delivery managers and technical operations staff
- We agreed realistic commitments and met the SLA to clients such as UBS, Deutsche Bank, BONY, BofAmerica and Handelsbanken.

#### CLARIFICATION OF USER REQUIREMENTS
Details clarification - testing always exposes questions.  
Introduces real world and users to the running of code.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device.  Checks that the interpretation of the requirement is in line with the user use of application. 
Observational understanding of user challenges feed into full end to end testing scripts. More recently in agile projects where these are brought up front into definition of user stories, key questions testers have define the requirements.

#### INDUSTRY SECTOR KNOWLEDGE
Consumer credit and finance, FX and Trade reconciliation services, Energy, Digital marketing (price comparison website), airline industry. 

- Functional and integration tests of software require the ability to learn business workflows fast. 
- Many projects incorporate legacy data feeds or interface to existing systems
- Reviews of existing data flows interfacing into company systems give vital information to base new functionality on

  -   I led UI testing (C# auto framework) of a new Application form, interfacing to EHL switching API. 
  -   Use of Postman, Fiddler to replicate and exercise the REST and JSON messaging to try out numerous energy switches.
  -   Hands on experience extending an existing Automation C# framework, using selenium webdriver and GIT.
- Example being Compare The Market Energy workflow https://energy.comparethemarket.com/energy/v2/

- I managed the last phase test activities for a UI migration to a new platform for Experian e-ConsumerView.
- http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer-information/econsumerview.html
I accrued knowledge of credit risk feeds, client product integration and common interface issues between MainFrame and C# UI
fed by XML data sets. 

## INDIRECT SKILLS OF GREAT USE IN CODING
####Details clarification
TEsting introduces the real world and users to the running of code, thus exposes questions and reveals gaps.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device. Checks that the interpretation of the requirement is in line with the user use of application.
OVer many projects and organisations the same questions arise, a good tester becomes a touchstone and develops uncanny ability to predict issues.  

#### COMMUNICATION 
- Timely and accurate updates to stakeholders of current status of quality and the severity to show impact on project status against plan
- Clarification of ideas and translation of aspirations into a real plan.
- Management of people - listening, echoing back to help refine and clarify their development concerns and goals. I have mentored and trained up 6 novice testers, all of whom are still progressing in their test careers.
- I implemented a personal development tool to clarify the agile test role and ensure test engineers were given a clear learning path for agile proficiency.

####INTERESTS

Social history - I take time to visit museums and discover more about the area I am visiting or reside in. 

Life long border collie owner so I am a habitual rambler, particularly around scenic parts of UK, Rutland, Wiltshire, anywhere I am you will find me likely to pop out with OS map to explore.
Know the phrase “Whatever the weather we’ll weather the weather, whether we like it or not!”
Member of Wildlife Trust - attend talks and volunteer on weekend work parties

Regular ASA “swim fit” attendee, veteran black run skier and ex long distance runner.

Active contributor to the North Luffenham village plan which aims to secure a sustainable and affordable living environment across generations, ensuring longevity of the village and its environment. 
This has already fed me ideas I would like to pursue for applications to encourage dog walkers to share and feed back on walks, plus an app to encourage and motivate teenage interaction with their communities.
