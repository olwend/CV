## Olwen Davies DRAFT

I am currently undertaking an intensive coding boot camp with Makers Academy, London, with a view to seeking a Software Dev Engineer in Test role (SDET) in a continuous integration agile development team. 
  Further information available here https://medium.com/@olwend.
I have several years experience as a test manager, after which I moved into Test analyst contract roles.I have been equally able to apply hands on test skills as to manage local, 3rd party and remote teams. I have a consistent record of efficient yet rigorous risk based testing tailored to project timelines and business client needs.  Relishing hands on technical work, aside from the management of teams and projects, I have taken interim roles moving towards automated testing.  Seeing the power of early quality input, by which a test professional uses a code based framework to write functional tests as an independent check whilst development is underway, I became more interested in Test Driven Development. I am taking time now, to  raise my technical game and so assure my contribution and effectiveness on team driven agile projects. My aim is to be a pragmatic, tactical tester suited to technical work  assuring the test role is an integral part of a Continuous Integration environment on all projects and teams I take part in.  

I have wide interests and I see huge benefits to technology being more widely understood and better applied, thus I want to return to my starting point in IT, where I realised user ideas for understood tasks and where I was driving a product for the end user or commissioners who were the people liaising with the creative and technical team.  

## SKILLS - ADD MATRIX 

#### TESTING - SUMMARISE DIFFERENT ROLES / KEY EXAMPLES / WHAT I LEARNT IN DIFFT ROLES - CHOICE RE. STEP DOWN
- I rose through test ranks, increasing my technical test skills and refining management skills as QUALITY MANAGER FOR TREASURY AND POST TRADE at REUTERS PLC. In this role I managed 4 Test Team Leads, taking overall responsibility for a large test team, across 8 workstreams, ensuring product deliverables were timely and to rigorous enterprise standards.   
- My team met group automation targets every year, I worked with auto testers to implement a flexible, repeatable data driven framework. With atechnical team in Beijing, my area achieved 30% automation of new functions & 70% on regression in 6 months. 
- Working to tight client UAT schedules I ran integration test phases, where investment bank trading engines could trial new algorithms against production like trading data. Key to this was liaison with client and TR architects, product delivery managers and technical operations staff. We agreed realistic commitments and met the SLA to clients such as UBS, Deutsche Bank, BONY, BofAmerica and Handelsbanken.
- Ultimately after being a manager through several rounds of redundancy, I decided VR was attractive and pursued hands on testing roles. 

BREAKDOWN TAKEAWAYS FROM LAST 5 YEARS -> GENERATED THIRST FOR TECHNICAL SKILLSET DO THINGS MORE EFFICIENTLY/ THOROUGHLY WITH AUTOMATION.

#### INDUSTRY SECTOR KNOWLEDGE
Consumer credit and finance, FX and Trade reconciliation services, Energy, Digital marketing (price comparison website), airline industry. 

- Functional and integration tests of software require the ability to learn business workflows fast. 
- Many projects incorporate legacy data feeds or interface to existing systems
- Reviews of existing data flows interfacing into company systems give vital information to base new functionality on

  -   I led UI testing (C# auto framework) of a new Application form, interfacing to EHL switching API. 
  -   Use of Postman, Fiddler to replicate and exercise the REST and JSON messaging to try out numerous energy switches.
  -   Hands on experience extending an existing Automation C# framework, using selenium webdriver and GIT.
- Example being Compare The Market Energy workflow https://energy.comparethemarket.com/energy/v2/

- I managed the last phase test activities for a UI migration to a new platform for Experian e-ConsumerView.
- http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer-information/econsumerview.html
I accrued knowledge of credit risk feeds, client product integration and common interface issues between MainFrame and C# UI
fed by XML data sets. 

## INDIRECT SKILLS OF GREAT USE IN CODING

#### CLARIFICATION OF USER REQUIREMENTS
Testing introduces the real world and users to the running of code, thus exposes questions and reveals gaps.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device. Checks that the interpretation of the requirement is in line with the user use of application.
Over many projects and organisations the same questions arise, a good tester becomes a touchstone and develops uncanny ability to predict issues. I have learnt to trust my hunches and ability to evidence risks prior to their breaking as issues. 

#### COMMUNICATION 
- Timely and accurate updates to stakeholders of current status of quality and the severity to show impact on project status against plan
- Clarification of ideas and translation of aspirations into a real plan, which peers and overall team can enact.
- Challenging participant in agile scrum and planning sessions.
- Management of people - listening, echoing back to help refine and clarify their development concerns and goals. I have mentored and trained up 6 novice testers, all of whom are still progressing in their test careers.
- I implemented a personal development tool to clarify the agile test role and ensure test engineers were given a clear learning path for agile proficiency.

####INTERESTS

Social history - I take time to visit museums and discover more about the area I am visiting or reside in. 

Life long border collie owner so I am a habitual rambler, particularly around scenic parts of UK, Rutland, Wiltshire, anywhere I am you will find me likely to pop out with OS map to explore.
