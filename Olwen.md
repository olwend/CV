## Olwen Davies 

 An MA graduate with 17 years in IT Support, Data analysis & QA. I am seeking a role where I can apply my industry experience and continue to advance my development skills.  I joined MA to raise my technical game and learn in a practical way.I grew my skills from coding test frameworks to proficiency in Ruby, Rails, JS and am learning JAVA having used it on an 8 week HSBC placement. I am prepared to dig in and learn whatever is required to be successful in a new role. [Meme based Final project](https://bemymeme.herokuapp.com/) 

 At HSBC I worked in a team of 4 using Java/h2/Spring/Typescript and Angular2 to deliver MVP on a resource management tool,pushed to an enterprise Pivotal cloud domain within 8 weeks.

I have wide interests, enjoying exhibitions and the visual richness that is London. I see huge benefits to technology being more widely understood and better applied, thus I want to  realise user ideas for understood tasks and drive products tightly bound to end users, where commissioners liaise with the creative and technical team.  I am interested in enabling technology in less digitally developed sectors and age groups.  In 2002 I was PM for a voluntary project which delivered a Child Abuse Tracking System. This won a Business in The Community Award, presented to us by Prince Charles, and was adopted by many police forces nationally.  I am pairing with a friend to take a prototype Literacy app to MVP, so she can seek investment.

#### Skills built up in QA of great use in coding 

#### Clarification of Product owner/ User Requirements
Testing introduces the real world and users to the running of code, thus exposes questions and reveals gaps.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device. Checks that the interpretation of the requirement suits the users.

#### Communication
I am client focussed so see clear written and verbal communication as key to successful project delivery.
Examples of communication:
- Automated test suites as great demo tools to show non technical people what is being delivered.[Bank tech test](https://github.com/olwend/bank_tech_test)
- Timely and accurate written or verbal updates of progress and quality status to show current project status against plan.
- I'm a challenging participant in agile scrum and planning sessions.
- Assist peers to voice ideas and translate aspirations into a real plan, which a team can enact.
- Mentoring via listening, echoing back to help refine and clarify individuals personal development concerns and goals. I am proud to have mentored and trained up 6 novice testers, all are still progressing in their test careers.

#### Issue Reporting and Debugging
I enjoy the challenge of understanding legacy code, implementing tests to give clarity and documentation of system functions.
See this example of implementing tests as a basis for refactoring [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/olwend/Gilded_rose) 

#### Understanding of large enterprise systems
I have wide experience in integrated corporate domains, having worked for 5 blue chip clients over the last 5 years.

I managed the last phase test activities for a UI migration to a new platform for [Experian e-ConsumerView](http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer-information/econsumerview.html)
The actual site is restricted to subscribing finance clients. 

I led UI testing (C# auto framework) of a new Application form, interfacing to Energy Helpline switching API.

I worked on the delivery tests for [Meerkat Movies](https://www.comparethemarket.com/meerkat/movies)
This was challenging as due to hard deadline to coincide with the press releases and marketing campaign.
