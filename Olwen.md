## Olwen Davies 

 An MA graduate with 15 years in IT QA I am seeking a role where I can apply my industry experience and continue to advance my development skills.  I joined MA to raise my technical game and learn in a practical way. I am seeking a role where I can apply my industry experience and advance my development skills with hands on work. During Makers I grew my skills from coding test frameworks to proficiency in Ruby, Rails and JS. I am able to learn new languages and frameworks, am prepared to dig in and learn whatever is required to be successful in a new role. [Meme based Final project](https://bemymeme.herokuapp.com/) 

Immediately after Makers I was assigned to a short term project at HSBC. As a team of 4 we used Java/h2/Spring/Typescript and Angular2 to deliver MVP on a resource management tool, addressing all user stories and pushing to an enterprise cloud domain within 8 weeks.

I have wide interests, enjoying exhibitions and the visual richness that is London. I see huge benefits to technology being more widely understood and better applied, thus I want to  realise user ideas for understood tasks and drive products tightly bound to end users, where commissioners liaise with the creative and technical team.  I am interested in enabling technology in less digitally developed sectors and age groups. 

As a life long border collie owner I am a habitual rambler, particularly around scenic parts of London, Rutland and the Peak district, anywhere I can, I'm likely to pop out with an OS map to explore and in a city find the quaint and quirky good value watering holes.

I believe we get out of situations as much as we put in, thus I have been an active contributor to the environment and youth engagement sections of North Luffenham village plan, where my family lives an aim being to secure  sustainable and affordable living across this and future generations, ensuring longevity and affordability of the village environment. In 2002 I was PM for a voluntary project which delivered a Child Abuse Tracking System. This won a Business in The Community Award, presented to us by Prince Charles, and was adopted by many police forces nationally.

## INDIRECT SKILLS OF GREAT USE IN CODING

#### CLARIFICATION OF USER REQUIREMENTS
Testing introduces the real world and users to the running of code, thus exposes questions and reveals gaps.  Sets the code in the wider context of environment, accessibility and device. Checks that the interpretation of the requirement suits the users.

#### COMMUNICATION 
I am client focussed so see clear written and verbal communication as key to successful project delivery.
Examples of communication:
- Automated test suites as great demo tools to show non technical people what is being delivered.[Bank tech test](https://github.com/olwend/bank_tech_test)
- Timely and accurate written or verbal updates of progress and quality status to show current project status against plan.
- I'm a challenging participant in agile scrum and planning sessions.
- Assist peers to voice ideas and translate aspirations into a real plan, which a team can enact.
- Mentoring via listening, echoing back to help refine and clarify individuals personal development concerns and goals. I am proud to have mentored and trained up 6 novice testers, all are still progressing in their test careers.

#### ISSUE REPORTING AND DEBUGGING
I enjoy the challenge of understanding legacy code, implementing tests to give clarity and documentation of system functions.
See this example of implementing tests as a basis for refactoring [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/olwend/Gilded_rose) 

#### UNDERSTANDING OF LARGE ENTERPRISE IT SYSTEMS
I have wide experience in integrated corporate domains, having worked for 5 blue chip clients over the last 5 years.

I managed the last phase test activities for a UI migration to a new platform for [Experian e-ConsumerView](http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer-information/econsumerview.html)
The actual site is restricted to subscribing finance clients. 

I led UI testing (C# auto framework) of a new Application form, interfacing to Energy Helpline switching API.

I worked on the delivery tests for [Meerkat Movies](https://www.comparethemarket.com/meerkat/movies)
This was challenging as due to hard deadline to coincide with the press releases and marketing campaign.
